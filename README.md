# Push-Based ngx-virtual-scrolling

**This is a fork of [@rx-angulars](https://github.com/rx-angular/rx-angular) [virtual-scrolling](https://www.rx-angular.io/docs/template/api/virtual-scrolling) implementation**

If you are interested in the most recent version with all the RxAngular features, please install the original version.

This version is specifically designed to work with angular v12 and without any usage of RxAngulars [RenderStrategies](https://www.rx-angular.io/docs/cdk/render-strategies).

Some features implemented in this version will be backported to the RxAngular original implementation.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @push-based/ngx-virtual-scrolling -S
```

## Demo Application

There is a demo application included in the repository which showcases most of the features. Run the following command
to serve the demo application.

```bash
npm run start
```
